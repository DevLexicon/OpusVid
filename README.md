### What is OpusVid?
OpusVid is a video content management system or CMS for short. With this video CMS user are able to create accounts, login to to a dashboard area, upload videos, manage their videos, create Opus Collections (playlists), manage their collections, watch other videos uploaded by other Opus Creators, follow other Opus Creators, add videos to a Watch Later List and more!

### What was the general thoughts throughout this project?
With the creation of this project I learnt some valuable skills ranging from understanding PHP code in an easy to understand format! There was parts of this assignment that I thought was going to be easy which ended up by being harder to the complete opposite of expecting code to be harder when it was easy! I do wish that I had commented my code as I was going! However, I didnâ€™t as the code was changing so much from learning new things to cleaning the code up and would this need to be rewriting comments more than not.

### Why was OpusVid created?
OpusVId was created as Directed Study at Vancouver Island University for DIGI 405 from Donald Louch with support from professor Robin Davies. The reasoning for the project was that in the past years YouTube has been going on a downward spiral and losing the trust from their Content Creators from the changes in which they implemented in February of 2018 to the YouTube Partnership Program. To the issues with YouTube's algorithms with content ID, recommendations and subscription boxes, and the 2017 LGBTQ+ Controversy with the age restriction algorithms. With this I would like to take the opportunity to create my own CMS in which I would allow people to upload videos to and create a more organic community to that of YouTube.
