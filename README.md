### Community Version (CV)
The "**Community Version (CV)**" will be a **FREE** version of OpusVid in which is open sourced. This version will be available here on [GitHub](https://github.com/DevLexicon/OpusVid/).

With the CV the documentation will be very limited and bare-bone. 

In addition, once the full script is launched the CV will only receive major updates and will receive them at a later time than the other versions. For instance, the paid version will get version 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.1, etc. Whereas, the CV will only get version 1.0, 2.0.

The CV will not include much support from DevLexicon (the developers of OpusVid) and will be encouraged to use the "**[Issues](https://github.com/DevLexicon/OpusVid/issues)**" tab on the GitHub repository.

If you submit multiple "**Pull requests**" that are beneficial to the script, DevLexicon may decide to award you a paid license for free.
